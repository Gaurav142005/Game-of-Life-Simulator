# Game-of-Life-Simulator

This is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. The simulation displays the evolution of a two-dimensional grid of cells, adhering to the rules of the Game of Life.

## Game Rules

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Every generation is simulated as:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation (survival).
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## Features of the Simulation:-
1. You can generate a random simulation, or create one of your own, or choose some pre defined grid patterns.
2. You can either play each simulation manually using the spacebar, or simulate it by pressing the simulate button.
3. You can clear any simulation at any point using the Clear button.
4. You can generate a random simulation at any point using the Randomise button.
5. Press P for pause, A for the '101' pattern, 'UP' for zoom in, 'DOWN' for zoom out.
6. Number of generations of a particular simulation is also displayed.
